# Security Vulnerability Report - Purrfect Stays

**Date:** January 16, 2025  
**Conducted by:** Security Audit

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit has identified several critical vulnerabilities in the Purrfect Stays codebase that require immediate attention. The most serious finding is the exposure of sensitive API keys and service role keys in the repository.

## Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. **EXPOSED API KEYS AND SECRETS** ðŸš¨

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Files Affected:** 
- `.env` file contains exposed production keys
- Multiple script files contain console.log statements that could leak sensitive data

**Details:**
- **Supabase Service Role Key** is exposed in `.env`: `sb_secret_Ql7kWyihhXMnhuTBLVWxNw_GT4jc4tD`
- **Resend API Key** is exposed: `re_cUAj61Sw_Bwwxft7M9sNw66LRYDLdeVyn`
- **Supabase Anon Key** is exposed: `sb_publishable_t9qTtsvsmU_wfDyL-rj0_g5mFNbST`
- These keys are committed to the repository and could be accessed by anyone with repository access

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Rotate ALL exposed keys immediately** in Supabase and Resend dashboards
2. Remove `.env` file from git history using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
3. Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`
4. Never commit actual API keys to the repository

### 2. **Overly Permissive CORS Configuration**

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Files Affected:** 
- `supabase/functions/send-verification-email/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/send-welcome-email/index.ts`

**Details:**
- CORS headers are set to allow ALL origins: `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'`
- This allows any website to call your Edge Functions and potentially abuse them

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': allowedOrigin, // Use specific origin instead of '*'
```

## High-Risk Vulnerabilities

### 3. **Unsafe-eval and Unsafe-inline in CSP**

**Severity:** HIGH  
**File:** `netlify.toml`

**Details:**
- Content Security Policy includes `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` for scripts
- This weakens XSS protection significantly

**Recommended Actions:**
- Remove `'unsafe-eval'` completely
- Replace `'unsafe-inline'` with nonce-based or hash-based script allowlisting
- Use strict CSP directives

### 4. **Console.log Statements with Sensitive Data**

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Files Affected:**
- `scripts/diagnostic-complete.js` - Logs API key prefixes
- `src/services/waitlistService.ts` - Logs user registration data
- `src/services/unifiedEmailVerificationService.ts` - Logs verification tokens

**Recommended Actions:**
- Remove all console.log statements that contain sensitive data
- Use structured logging with appropriate log levels
- Never log API keys, tokens, or user PII in production

## Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities

### 5. **Rate Limiting Implementation**

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Details:**
- Rate limiting is implemented client-side which can be bypassed
- No server-side rate limiting in Edge Functions

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement rate limiting at the Edge Function level
- Use Supabase's built-in rate limiting features
- Consider implementing CAPTCHA for critical operations

### 6. **Email Validation**

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Details:**
- Basic regex validation for emails could miss edge cases
- Disposable email detection is client-side only

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement server-side email validation
- Use a more robust email validation library
- Consider email verification before allowing critical actions

## Low-Risk Findings

### 7. **No SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Found** âœ…
- All database queries use Supabase's query builder
- No raw SQL queries detected
- Parameterized queries are used throughout

### 8. **No XSS Vulnerabilities Found** âœ…
- No usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- User input is properly escaped in React components
- No direct DOM manipulation with user input

### 9. **Good Input Validation** âœ…
- Forms have client-side validation
- Edge Functions validate input parameters
- Type checking is enforced with TypeScript

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Anti-Bot Measures** âœ…
   - Honeypot fields
   - Math CAPTCHA
   - Browser fingerprinting
   - Interaction tracking

2. **TypeScript Usage** âœ…
   - Strong typing throughout the application
   - Reduces type-related vulnerabilities

3. **Security Headers** âœ…
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-XSS-Protection enabled

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Within 24 hours):
1. **Rotate all exposed API keys**
2. **Remove sensitive data from git history**
3. **Fix CORS configuration in Edge Functions**
4. **Remove console.log statements with sensitive data**

### Short-term Actions (Within 1 week):
1. **Implement server-side rate limiting**
2. **Strengthen CSP by removing unsafe-eval**
3. **Add environment variable validation on startup**
4. **Implement proper logging without sensitive data**

### Long-term Actions (Within 1 month):
1. **Set up secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline**
2. **Implement security monitoring and alerting**
3. **Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning**
4. **Security training for development team**

## Conclusion

While the application has good security practices in many areas (TypeScript, input validation, anti-bot measures), the exposed API keys represent a critical security breach that must be addressed immediately. The overly permissive CORS configuration and CSP with unsafe-eval also pose significant risks.

After addressing the critical vulnerabilities, the application will have a much stronger security posture. Regular security audits and automated scanning should be implemented to prevent future vulnerabilities.

## Appendix: Secure Configuration Examples

### Secure CORS Configuration:
```typescript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://purrfectstays.org',
  'https://www.purrfectstays.org'
];

const origin = req.headers.get('origin');
const corsHeaders = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': allowedOrigins.includes(origin) ? origin : allowedOrigins[0],
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, OPTIONS',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',
};
```

### Secure CSP Configuration:
```toml
Content-Security-Policy = """
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'nonce-{GENERATED_NONCE}' https://*.google-analytics.com;
  style-src 'self' 'nonce-{GENERATED_NONCE}' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
  connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://*.google-analytics.com;
  frame-ancestors 'none';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
"""
```

### Environment Variable Security:
```typescript
// Add to startup validation
const requiredEnvVars = ['VITE_SUPABASE_URL', 'VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'];
for (const envVar of requiredEnvVars) {
  if (!import.meta.env[envVar]) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required environment variable: ${envVar}`);
  }
}
```
