# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX: Email Verification Not Working

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING:
- ‚úÖ Resend API is functional  
- ‚úÖ Custom domain `purrfectstays.org` is verified
- ‚úÖ Edge Function is responding correctly
- ‚úÖ Email addresses `hello@purrfectstays.org` and `noreply@purrfectstays.org` work

## üéØ THE PROBLEM:
**Environment variables are NOT set in Supabase Edge Functions**

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (5 minutes):

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Supabase
1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wllsdbhjhzquiyfklhei/settings/edge-functions
2. **Click**: "Environment Variables" tab
3. **Add these variables**:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_eDrErBGV_FiTqQn5uVHt5oXVpKD9h8fTU
   SITE_URL=https://purrfectstays.org
   ```
4. **Save** the configuration

### Step 2: Redeploy Edge Functions  
After setting environment variables, you need to redeploy:

**Option A: Via Supabase CLI (if you have it installed):**
```bash
supabase functions deploy send-verification-email
supabase functions deploy send-welcome-email
```

**Option B: Via Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Edge Functions in dashboard
2. Click on `send-verification-email`
3. Click "Deploy" button
4. Repeat for `send-welcome-email`

### Step 3: Test Immediately
After redeployment (wait 1-2 minutes), test with your real email:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://wllsdbhjhzquiyfklhei.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-verification-email' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6IndsbHNkYmhqaHpxdWl5ZmtsaGVpIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDk3NTg0OTgsImV4cCI6MjA2NTMzNDQ5OH0.ky41Rcy9ZsmYStEIdC6jGqNer6WBcpbDVFvQs6Mk0Go' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Origin: https://purrfectstays.org' \
  -d '{"email": "YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com", "name": "Test User", "verificationToken": "test123", "userType": "cat-parent"}'
```

**Expected Response After Fix:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "messageId": "some-message-id",
  "note": "Sent using custom domain."
}
```

## üîç WHY THIS HAPPENED:
The Edge Function was using a fallback/default configuration because the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable wasn't available in the Supabase environment. This caused it to use Resend's default sending domain instead of your verified custom domain.

## üìß AFTER THE FIX:
- ‚úÖ Emails will be sent from `hello@purrfectstays.org`
- ‚úÖ Better deliverability (not marked as spam)
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance
- ‚úÖ Proper branding consistency

## üö® IF STILL NOT WORKING AFTER THE FIX:

### Check Spam Folder:
Even with custom domain, initial emails might still go to spam until sender reputation is established.

### Test with Multiple Email Providers:
- Gmail: Check both inbox and spam
- Outlook: Check junk folder
- Yahoo: Check spam folder

### Check Email Content:
The emails should now show:
- **From**: Purrfect Stays <hello@purrfectstays.org>
- **Subject**: üöÄ Verify Your Email - Purrfect Stays Early Access
- **Content**: Professional template with working verification link

## üìä VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Environment variables set in Supabase
- [ ] Edge Functions redeployed
- [ ] Test API call returns "Sent using custom domain"
- [ ] Registration on website sends email
- [ ] Email received (check spam folder)
- [ ] Verification link works correctly

## ‚è±Ô∏è ESTIMATED TIME TO FIX: 5-10 minutes

**The technical infrastructure is solid - this is just a configuration issue that needs the environment variables properly set in Supabase.**
