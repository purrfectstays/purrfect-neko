# Spec: Advanced Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
Build a comprehensive analytics dashboard that leverages our existing quiz analytics functions and MCP integrations for real-time insights into user behavior, conversion patterns, and business metrics.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live user registration, quiz completion, and conversion rates
- **Geographic Analysis**: User distribution by country/region with revenue opportunities
- **User Segmentation**: High-value, growth potential, standard, and price-sensitive segments
- **Conversion Funnel**: Registration → Verification → Quiz → Success flow analysis
- **Performance Monitoring**: Page load times, error rates, accessibility compliance

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Dashboard loads in <2s, updates in real-time
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with screen reader support
- **Security**: No sensitive data exposure, proper authentication
- **Mobile**: Responsive design for mobile analytics review

## Design

### Data Architecture
```typescript
interface AnalyticsDashboard {
  realTimeMetrics: {
    activeUsers: number;
    registrationsToday: number;
    quizCompletionRate: number;
    conversionRate: number;
  };
  
  geographicData: GeographicAnalytics[];
  userSegments: UserSegmentAnalytics[];
  conversionFunnel: ConversionFunnelData[];
  performanceMetrics: PerformanceData;
}
```

### UI Components
- **MetricsGrid**: Real-time KPI cards with trend indicators
- **GeographicMap**: Interactive world map with user distribution
- **SegmentChart**: Pie/bar charts for user segmentation
- **FunnelVisualization**: Conversion funnel with drop-off analysis
- **PerformancePanel**: System health and performance metrics

### MCP Integration Points
- **Supabase MCP**: Query analytics functions we created this morning
- **Google Analytics MCP**: Web analytics data (once service account configured)
- **Linear MCP**: Create issues for optimization opportunities
- **GitHub MCP**: Track feature development progress

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Analytics (Week 1)
- [ ] Set up analytics service using existing Supabase functions
- [ ] Create basic dashboard layout with MetricsGrid
- [ ] Implement real-time data fetching with proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add loading states and accessibility features

### Phase 2: Advanced Visualizations (Week 2)
- [ ] Integrate Recharts for geographic and segment visualizations
- [ ] Build interactive conversion funnel component
- [ ] Add export functionality for reports
- [ ] Implement responsive mobile design

### Phase 3: MCP Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] Connect Google Analytics MCP for web metrics
- [ ] Integrate Linear MCP for automated issue creation
- [ ] Add GitHub MCP for development tracking
- [ ] Implement automated reporting workflows

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
- [ ] Add predictive analytics for user behavior
- [ ] Implement A/B testing insights
- [ ] Create automated alerts for anomalies
- [ ] Build custom report builder

## Technical Specifications

### Database Queries
Leverage existing analytics functions:
- `get_pricing_analytics()` - Pricing preferences by region
- `get_geographic_analytics()` - Geographic distribution and revenue
- `get_user_segment_analytics()` - User segmentation with scoring
- `get_conversion_funnel()` - Funnel analysis with drop-off rates

### Performance Requirements
- **Bundle Size**: Keep analytics components under 50KB gzipped
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient data structures, proper cleanup
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time updates every 30 seconds
- **Caching**: Implement smart caching for expensive queries

### Security Considerations
- **Data Access**: Use service role key for analytics queries
- **User Privacy**: Aggregate data only, no PII exposure
- **Authentication**: Admin-only access to sensitive metrics
- **Audit Logging**: Track who accesses what analytics data

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Analytics service functions
- [ ] Chart component rendering
- [ ] Data transformation utilities
- [ ] Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- [ ] MCP server connectivity
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Real-time update mechanisms
- [ ] Export functionality

### Accessibility Tests
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Color contrast compliance
- [ ] ARIA label validation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Dashboard load time: <2s
- Real-time update latency: <1s
- Accessibility score: >95%
- Mobile performance: >90%

### Business Metrics
- Analytics adoption rate by team
- Time to insight improvement
- Decision-making speed increase
- User behavior understanding depth

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- Recharts for visualizations (already installed)
- Date-fns for date handling
- React Query for data fetching
- Framer Motion for animations (optional)

### MCP Servers
- Supabase MCP (configured)
- Google Analytics MCP (needs service account)
- Linear MCP (configured)
- GitHub MCP (configured)

### Database Functions
All analytics functions created this morning are ready:
- Quiz analytics functions ✅
- Geographic analysis functions ✅
- User segmentation functions ✅
- Conversion funnel functions ✅

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Google Analytics MCP**: Needs service account configuration
- **Real-time Performance**: May impact database under load
- **Data Privacy**: Must ensure no PII exposure

### Medium Risk
- **Chart Performance**: Large datasets may slow rendering
- **Mobile Experience**: Complex charts on small screens
- **MCP Reliability**: Dependent on external service availability

### Low Risk
- **Database Queries**: Functions already tested and optimized
- **UI Components**: Building on existing design system
- **Authentication**: Using established patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Phase 1 implementation
2. **This Week**: Complete core analytics service
3. **Next Week**: Add visualizations and MCP integration
4. **Following Week**: Polish and deploy to production
