## 1. Pre-deployment Verification

### 1.1 Environment Variable Setup Validation

**What you're doing**: Making sure all required settings are properly configured before deployment.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open your project folder**
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\denni\.purrfectstays`
   - Look for a file named `.env.example`

2. **Create your environment file**
   - Right-click in the folder
   - Select "New" ‚Üí "Text Document"
   - Name it exactly: `.env` (remove the .txt extension)

   - Copy all contents
   - Paste into your new `.env` file

4. **Fill in your values**
   Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys:
   ```
   # Frontend Variables (safe to expose)
