# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Startup Behavior

When starting a new Claude Code session in this project, offer the following options:

1. **Standard Mode** - Regular Claude Code assistance
2. **BMad-Method Mode** - Activate specialized agent framework

To activate BMad-Method, users can:
- Type `*help` to see all available agents and workflows
- Type `*agent bmad-orchestrator` to start with the orchestrator
- Type `*workflow-guidance` for help selecting the right workflow

The BMad-Method framework provides specialized agents (Analyst, PM, Architect, UX Expert, etc.) and structured workflows for development tasks. 

**Important**: The complete BMad-Method framework is stored in `/team-fullstack.txt` (417KB). This file contains all agent definitions, workflows, tasks, and knowledge base. Claude will load specific sections as needed rather than the entire file at once.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (runs on http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Project Architecture

This is a **React + TypeScript + Vite** waitlist landing page for Purrfect Stays, a cattery booking platform.

### Core Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions)
- **Email Service**: Resend API for verification and welcome emails
- **State Management**: React Context API (`src/context/AppContext.tsx`)
- **Routing**: React Router with step-based navigation and lazy loading
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Static Site Hosting with GitHub integration)

### Key Application Flow
The app follows a multi-step user journey managed by `AppContext`:
1. **Landing** ‚Üí **Registration** ‚Üí **Instant 6-Digit Verification** ‚Üí **Qualification Quiz** ‚Üí **Success**
2. State transitions are controlled via `currentStep` in the context
3. Each step is a separate component with its own route when needed
4. **Verification Process**: Uses instant 6-digit code verification (no email required)
5. **Security**: All verification happens on-the-spot with rate limiting and anti-spam measures

### Project Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # React components (forms, pages, UI elements)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context/            # React Context for global state
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # API integrations (Supabase, email, geolocation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/               # Utilities (Supabase client, analytics, monitoring)

supabase/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/        # Database schema migrations
```

### Database Schema (Supabase)
- **waitlist_users**: Main user table with verification status, quiz completion, and waitlist position
- **quiz_responses**: Stores user quiz answers linked to waitlist_users

### Key Services
- **waitlistService.ts**: User registration and waitlist management
- **unifiedEmailVerificationService.ts**: Instant verification with 6-digit codes (no email sending)
- **emailVerificationService.ts**: Legacy email verification (deprecated)
- **catteryService.ts**: Cattery-specific logic
- **githubService.ts**: GitHub integration features
- **geolocationService.ts**: Location-based functionality with timeout fallbacks
- **currencyService.ts**: Exchange rate API with graceful fallbacks

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Frontend (VITE_ prefix exposes to browser)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-app.netlify.app
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_google_analytics_id

# Backend Only (NO VITE_ prefix - server-side only)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY**: Never use `VITE_` prefix for sensitive keys (service role, API keys) as this exposes them to the browser!

## Deployment

### Netlify Deployment (Recommended)

This project is configured for seamless deployment on Netlify with GitHub integration.

#### Initial Setup:
1. **Connect GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Netlify will auto-detect the Vite framework

2. **Configure Environment Variables** in Netlify Dashboard:
   ```bash
   # Frontend Variables (safe to expose)
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   VITE_APP_URL=https://purrfectstays.org
   VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_google_analytics_id
   NODE_ENV=production
   
   # Backend Variables (NEVER use VITE_ prefix)
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
   ```
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Backend variables without `VITE_` prefix are server-only and secure.

3. **Deploy**:
   - Netlify automatically deploys on every push to `main` branch
   - Preview deployments created for pull requests
   - Production deployment available at your custom domain

#### Netlify Configuration:
- `netlify.toml`: Pre-configured with SPA routing, security headers, and optimization
- **Security Headers**: CSP, XSS protection, frame options, CORS policy
- **API Whitelisting**: Exchange Rate API, geolocation APIs, Google Analytics
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Node version: 18
- **Recent Updates**: Added Exchange Rate API to CSP connect-src for currency features

#### Post-Deployment:
1. **Update Supabase Settings**:
   - Add Netlify domain to Supabase Auth URL allowlist
   - Update CORS settings in Edge Functions (use specific origins, not wildcard)
   - Set `SITE_URL` in Edge Functions to your Netlify URL
   - Verify RLS policies are properly configured

2. **Security Verification**:
   - Confirm no VITE_ prefixed sensitive keys in browser
   - Test CORS policies work with your domain
   - Verify CSP headers are not blocking legitimate requests
   - Check all external API calls work (geolocation, currency, analytics)

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Replace localhost URLs with your Netlify domain
   - Ensure all API keys are properly set in Netlify dashboard
   - Test Edge Functions have access to server-side environment variables

4. **Custom Domain** (Optional):
   - Add custom domain in Netlify dashboard
   - Update DNS records as instructed
   - Update all environment variables with new domain
   - Update Supabase allowed origins list

### Build Configuration
- Uses Vite with performance optimizations (chunk splitting, compression)
- Bundle analysis available at `dist/bundle-analysis.html` after build
- Lazy loading implemented for heavy components (Quiz, GitHub integration)
- Source maps enabled for production debugging

### Authentication & Email System
- **Verification**: Instant 6-digit code verification (no email sending required)
- **Welcome emails**: Triggered after quiz completion via Supabase Edge Functions
- **Email API**: Uses Resend API with custom email templates
- **Security**: Rate limiting, CAPTCHA, honeypot fields, and anti-spam measures
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when external APIs fail

## Claude Development Rules

When working with this codebase, follow these essential rules:

### üìã Task Management & Planning
1. **First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and use TodoWrite tool to create a plan.**
2. **The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them**
3. **Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.**
4. **Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as completed in real-time as you go.**
5. **Use TodoWrite tool frequently to track progress and keep user informed**

### üîç Code Quality & Simplicity
6. **Make every task and code change as simple as possible. Avoid massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.**
7. **Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made**
8. **All data and information displayed to users must be factual and accurate. Never show simulated, mock, or fake data - only real information or clearly marked placeholders.**

### üîí Security-First Development
9. **Always run security checks before deployment: verify no exposed secrets, test CSP headers, validate CORS settings**
10. **Never expose sensitive keys with VITE_ prefix - use server-side environment variables**
11. **Test all external API integrations after CSP/CORS changes**

### üìà User Communication
12. **ALWAYS provide detailed step-by-step instructions for non-technical users. Since the user has zero coding experience, include:**
    - Exact button names and locations
    - What screens should look like
    - Where to click, what to type (exactly)
    - Expected results after each step
    - Simple explanations of what's happening
    - Screenshots descriptions when helpful
    - Common mistakes to avoid
    - What to do if something goes wrong
13. **Let me know when you have a better suggestion or idea so we can lockhorns**

### üöÄ Recent Best Practices Learned
- **Use Task tool for complex research** rather than multiple grep/search operations
- **Batch tool calls** when possible for better performance
- **Always verify build success** after security or API changes
- **Update CLAUDE.md** after significant architectural changes

## Working with This Codebase

- **Adding new components**: Follow existing patterns in `src/components/`
- **Database changes**: Create new migration files in `supabase/migrations/`
- **New API endpoints**: Use Supabase Edge Functions (check existing functions for patterns)
- **State management**: Extend `AppContext` for global state, use local state for component-specific data
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes, follow the dark theme with indigo accents
- **Type safety**: Add types to `src/types/` and import as needed

## Context Engineering Integration

This project uses Context Engineering principles to ensure high-quality, consistent AI-assisted development.

### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context

- **Always check `examples/` directory** for patterns before implementing new features
- **Read relevant PRPs** in `PRPs/` for detailed implementation blueprints
- **Use TodoWrite tool** to plan complex features before implementation
- **Follow existing patterns** rather than introducing new ones

### üß± Code Structure & Modularity

#### React Component Guidelines
- **Component files < 300 lines**. Split into smaller components if larger
- **One component per file** with clear, descriptive names
- **Organize by feature** in subdirectories (e.g., `components/waitlist/`, `components/quiz/`)
- **Use TypeScript interfaces** for all props and state
- **Export types separately** from `src/types/` for reusability

#### Service Layer Rules
- **Services handle all external API calls** (Supabase, Resend, etc.)
- **Return typed responses** with proper error handling
- **Use async/await** consistently, never mix with .then()
- **Implement retry logic** for critical operations
- **Log errors** but don't expose sensitive data

### üß™ Testing & Reliability

- **Write tests for new features** using Vitest patterns
- **Test file structure**: `__tests__/` folders next to components
- **Include tests for**:
  - Happy path (expected behavior)
  - Error states (API failures, validation errors)
  - Edge cases (empty data, boundary conditions)
  - Loading states
- **Mock external services** (Supabase, Resend) in tests
- **Maintain > 80% coverage** for new code

### ‚úÖ Validation Commands

Before committing any changes, run:
```bash
# TypeScript type checking
npm run typecheck

# ESLint for code quality
npm run lint

# Build to ensure no compilation errors
npm run build

# Run tests (when implemented)
npm run test
```

### üìé Style & Conventions

#### TypeScript Conventions
- **Strict mode enabled** - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Use type inference** where possible, explicit types where helpful
- **Prefer interfaces over types** for object shapes
- **Use enums** for fixed sets of values
- **Generic types** for reusable components/hooks

#### React Patterns
- **Functional components only** - no class components
- **Custom hooks** for reusable logic (prefix with `use`)
- **Memoization** for expensive computations (React.memo, useMemo)
- **Error boundaries** for graceful error handling
- **Suspense boundaries** for code splitting

#### Tailwind CSS Guidelines
- **Mobile-first responsive design** (use sm:, md:, lg: prefixes)
- **Dark theme by default** with indigo accent colors
- **Consistent spacing** using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **No custom CSS** unless absolutely necessary
- **Component variants** using cn() utility for conditional classes

### üìö Documentation & Examples

- **Update examples/** when adding new patterns
- **Document complex logic** with inline comments
- **JSDoc comments** for exported functions and components
- **Update CLAUDE.md** immediately after significant changes
- **Keep security documentation current** with latest fixes and best practices
- **Document API integrations** including CSP requirements and fallback strategies

### üß† AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume context** - read existing code first
- **Follow established patterns** from examples/
- **Validate against TypeScript** before considering task complete
- **Check for existing utilities** before creating new ones
- **Respect file organization** - don't create files in wrong directories

### üîê Security Guidelines

#### Critical Security Rules (MUST FOLLOW)
- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, secrets) - Use .env.example for templates
- **Environment Variable Security**: Never use `VITE_` prefix for sensitive keys (exposes to browser)
- **Service Role Key**: Only use server-side in Edge Functions, never in frontend code
- **CORS Configuration**: Use specific allowed origins, never wildcard `*`
- **CSP Headers**: Maintain strict Content Security Policy in netlify.toml
- **API Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate all API keys and tokens
- **Deployment Security**: Always check browser devtools to ensure no secrets are exposed

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Verification System**: Uses instant 6-digit codes (no email verification required)
- **Rate Limiting**: Client-side with fingerprinting + server-side enforcement
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on both client and server
- **RLS Policies**: Proper Row Level Security in Supabase
- **Anti-Spam**: CAPTCHA, honeypot fields, disposable email detection

#### API Security
- **External APIs**: All APIs whitelisted in CSP connect-src
- **Timeout Handling**: 5-second timeouts with graceful fallbacks
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information leaked in error messages
- **Retry Logic**: Implemented for critical operations

#### Recent Security Audit Results
