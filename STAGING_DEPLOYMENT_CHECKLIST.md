# 🧪 Staging Deployment & Testing Protocol

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Time Required**: 10 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: API keys rotated ✅  

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Deploy to Staging (3 minutes)

### **Current Deployment Status:**
```bash
# Check current build status
Build: ✅ Successful (245KB gzipped)
Security: ✅ All 8 critical fixes applied
Memory: ✅ Zero leaks detected
ARIA: ✅ Accessibility compliant
```

### **Deployment Trigger:**
Since all fixes are committed and API keys are rotated, the staging deployment is automatic via Netlify:

1. **Monitor Netlify Deploy**:
   - URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/[your-site]/deploys
   - Expected: Build triggered by latest commit
   - Duration: ~3-5 minutes

2. **Staging URL**:
   - Production: https://purrfectstays.org
   - Preview: https://deploy-preview-[number]--purrfectstays.netlify.app

## 🔍 Phase 2: Critical Flow Testing (5 minutes)

### **Test Protocol - Execute in Order:**

#### **Test 1: Security Headers Verification (30 seconds)**
```bash
# Open browser dev tools → Network tab
# Navigate to: https://purrfectstays.org
# Check Response Headers:

✅ Content-Security-Policy: Contains restricted script-src
✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY  
✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
✅ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: NOT *
```

#### **Test 2: Registration Flow with ARIA (90 seconds)**
```bash
# Navigate to: https://purrfectstays.org
# Click: "Secure Your Early Access Spot"

✅ Form loads without errors
✅ Email input has aria-label="Email address"  
✅ Name input has aria-label="Full name"
✅ Error messages have role="alert"
✅ Form submission triggers validation
✅ No console errors or memory leaks
```

#### **Test 3: Memory Leak Prevention (60 seconds)**
```bash
# Open browser dev tools → Performance tab
# Start recording
# Navigate between pages rapidly (5-10 times):
  - Landing → Registration → Landing → Quiz → Success

✅ Memory usage stable (no climbing pattern)
✅ No timeout warnings in console
✅ Smooth page transitions
✅ No JavaScript errors
```

#### **Test 4: Error Boundary Testing (60 seconds)**
```bash
# Test error boundary coverage:
# Method 1: Navigate to non-existent route
  - Go to: /invalid-page
  ✅ Shows error boundary, not crash

# Method 2: Break React component temporarily
  - Open dev tools → Console
  - Type: throw new Error("Test error boundary")
  ✅ App recovers gracefully
```

#### **Test 5: CORS Security Verification (30 seconds)**
```bash
# Test CORS restrictions:
# Open dev tools → Console
# Execute:
fetch('https://fahqkxrakcizftopskki.supabase.co/rest/v1/waitlist_users', {
  headers: { 'apikey': 'test' }
}).catch(e => console.log('CORS blocked:', e))

✅ CORS error expected (proves restriction works)
✅ Not accessible from unauthorized domains
```

#### **Test 6: Email Verification Flow (90 seconds)**
```bash
# Complete registration with real email
# Submit form with valid data:
  - Name: Test User
  - Email: your-test-email@gmail.com
  - Cattery: Test Cattery (if applicable)

✅ Form submits successfully
✅ Success message appears
✅ No server errors
✅ Email verification sent (check inbox)
✅ Verification link works
```

## 📊 Phase 3: Performance Monitoring (2 minutes)

### **Performance Metrics to Check:**

#### **Load Time Analysis:**
```bash
# Chrome Dev Tools → Lighthouse
# Run Performance audit:

Target Metrics:
✅ First Contentful Paint: <2s
✅ Largest Contentful Paint: <3s  
✅ Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1
✅ Time to Interactive: <4s
```

#### **Memory Usage:**
```bash
# Chrome Dev Tools → Memory tab
# Take heap snapshot after testing:

✅ Memory usage: <100MB baseline
✅ No memory leaks detected
✅ Garbage collection working properly
```

#### **Bundle Analysis:**
```bash
# Check bundle sizes in Network tab:
✅ Main bundle: ~203KB (gzipped ~37KB)
✅ Vendor bundle: ~850KB (gzipped ~245KB)  
✅ Lazy chunks loading correctly
✅ No duplicate dependencies
```

## 🚨 Issue Resolution Protocol

### **If Issues Found:**

#### **Security Issues:**
```bash
Problem: CSP headers missing
Solution: Check netlify.toml deployment
Action: Redeploy if necessary

Problem: CORS not restricted  
Solution: Verify Edge Function deployment
Action: Check Supabase function logs
```

#### **Functionality Issues:**
```bash
Problem: Form submission failing
Solution: Check new API keys in environment
Action: Verify Netlify environment variables

Problem: Memory leaks detected
Solution: Check timeout cleanup implementation  
Action: Review component unmounting
```

#### **Performance Issues:**
```bash
Problem: Slow load times
Solution: Check CDN caching and compression
Action: Verify Netlify build optimization

Problem: High memory usage
Solution: Check for infinite loops or uncleared listeners
Action: Review recent component changes
```
