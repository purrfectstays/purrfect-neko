# Logo Update Instructions

## Steps to Replace the Logo

1. **Save the new logo image** that you provided in the chat as `logo.png`

2. **Replace the existing logo file**:
   - Navigate to the `public` folder in your project: `C:\Users\denni\.purrfectstays\public\`
   - Replace the existing `logo.png` file with your new logo image
   - Make sure the new file is named exactly `logo.png`

3. **Verify the update**:
   - The Logo component has been updated to use the image file (`/logo.png`)
   - It includes fallback support in case the image fails to load
   - The logo will now display the beautiful cat-themed logo you provided

## Technical Changes Made

- Updated `src/components/Logo.tsx` to use image files instead of SVG
- Added error handling with fallback to the previous SVG design
- Maintained all size variants (sm, md, lg) and component variants (icon, full)
- The logo now loads from `/logo.png` in the public directory

## After Replacing the File

Once you've replaced the logo.png file:
1. Commit the changes: `git add public/logo.png && git commit -m "Update logo with new design"`
2. Push to deploy: `git push`
3. The new logo will appear on your Vercel deployment

The logo component is now ready to display your beautiful new Purrfect Stays logo!
